### What happens if Sequence crashes?

We try to isolate parts of Sequence so that if one part fails, other parts can still work. But, in the event something uncaught causes a crash, you will see an error in the preview letting you know somehting went wrong.

Once this happens, the page will countdown to automatically refresh, or you can refresh the page yourself. Since everything in Sequence is saved, no work should be lost from the crash, and your session will restart where you left off.

If you experience repeated crashes or lost work from a crash, please let us know by [submitting an issue](/bugtracker/).
