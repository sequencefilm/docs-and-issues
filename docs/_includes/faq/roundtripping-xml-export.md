### Can I import or export timelines between Sequence and FCP/Pr/Resolve/Avid/etc.?

Not at this time. 

Currently, Sequence's data format is not compatible with other applications.

However, we are working on a way to import and export timelines between Sequence and other applications, using FCP7 XML packages and aligning with OTIO standards. Please reach out to us if this is something you are interested in and have ideas for how to see it work.
