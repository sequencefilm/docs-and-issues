### Why isn't the preview showing the right thing?

You might find that sometimes the preview isn't showing what you expect to see based off the content in the timeline. 

This is most often do to a desync between the timeline and preview that we are actively working to improve. But fret not, if you refresh the page, the timeline should reload and preview as expected.

If you can identify what is causing a desync for you or it's happening more than expected, please send an email to [team@sequence.film](mailto:team@sequence.film).
