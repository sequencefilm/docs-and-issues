### Why was I disconnected from inactivity?

When you're working in a Sequence project, cloud hardware is constantly running to give you a smooth experience, and the video stream is always broadcasting. 

To save on resources for both Sequence and the editor, we disconnect you from the project if you're inactive for 5 minutes. This means that if you're not interacting with the editor, you'll be disconnected.

Upon returning to a disconnected project, interacting with it will automatically refresh the page and start a new session. This will not affect your work, as everything is saved in real time.

Your project will not be disconnected due to inactivity if playback is in progress.
