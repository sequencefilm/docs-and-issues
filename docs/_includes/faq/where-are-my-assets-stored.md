### Where are my assets stored?

Sequence stores your assets in the cloud, so you can access them from anywhere. We use Google Cloud Storage to store your assets, which is a highly secure and reliable storage solution.

Instead of caching versions of the files client-side for editing, we keep all the assets centralized in our cloud project service, and do all the compositing and rendering in the cloud, then stream that back to you in realtime. 

This allows us to provide a seamless editing experience, and also allows us to provide a robust collaboration experience.
