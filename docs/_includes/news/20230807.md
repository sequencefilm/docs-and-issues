### August 7th, 2023 - Explore "The Sequence Method"

In the previous update, we talked about how the latest video project we worked on in Sequence gave us a chance to start testing some theories about modern, collaborative, video production. We called this process, "The Sequence Method." 

Now, we're excited to share a new section on the website to permanently capture these learnings about modern motion picture production: www.sequence.film/method

This is a living document that will continue to evolve as we learn more about how Sequence can help teams collaborate more effectively. We hope you'll check it out and let us know what you think!
