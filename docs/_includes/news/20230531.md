### May 31, 2023 â€” "First Look" Trailer

This past week, we've been crafting Sequence's official first look trailer, and tried so many new things.

We prototyped the film in the timeline with janky storyboards and AI-generated voiceover. We invited investors into the timeline to help guide the structure. We hired a voiceover artist to come in to watch the draft and then record directly into the project.

It felt like the first time everything in the product was really starting to click and we were approaching making film & video in a fundamentally different way. Enjoy this "First Look" at Sequence!
