If you're brand new to **Sequence** - this is the place for you! We'll walk you through the basics of getting started with **Sequence** and how to get involved with the community.

We are thrilled to have you using Sequence - an innovative multimedia collaboration platform. This early alpha release is an opportunity for you to test and provide feedback on our platform, helping us shape and improve it.

Our main focus is to provide you with a powerful multimedia supercomputer in the cloud, equipped with the ability to collaborate with multiple users. In this initial stage, Sequence is primarily designed to offer a smooth timeline editing experience and robust collaboration options. While more advanced video editing features will be added in the future, the Alpha Release is ideal for collaborating on and reviewing content, as well as creating simple videos without the need for complex effects.
