## Timeline Settings

When a timeline is chosen from the picker, the Inspector will display its settings. When a new timeline is created, it will utilize default settings. However, when the first clip is added, the timeline's settings will automatically adjust to closely match the clip. To further refine the settings, the resolution and frame rate can be manually set.
