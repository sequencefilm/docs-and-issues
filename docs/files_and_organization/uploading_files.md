Once files are uploaded, they will appear in the library. While thumbnails are generated and files are processed for use in Sequence, you will see a processing progress indicator on each file. Once a file  turns green and shows a file type icon on the left, you can start using them in Sequence!

## Upload in the Background

To keep your upload session safe from you accidentally navigating away from the page during uploading, you can start a remote uploading session.

Click the new window button in the uploads panel and your project will open in a new tab while the files continue to upload in the background.

## View New Files in the Inbox

Uploaded files will land in the inbox back in the Library tab, where they can be organized in the library or added directly to a timeline.
