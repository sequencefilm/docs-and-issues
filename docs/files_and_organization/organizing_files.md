## Using Folders to Organize Files

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ Note: Folder organization is currently only supported in list view. Grid view coming soon.

When you create a new folder, you can use it to organize files into hierarchical categories. Click and drag clips to drop them into a folder, or click and drag a folder to drop it inside of another folder.

To remove a child file or folder from its parent folder, click and drag it on top of the parent folder again. 

Currently, all files and folders are sorted alphabetically.
