## Previewing Library Items

Once a file is selected in the library:

-   Hover over the filmstrip preview to skim the contents of the file
-   Click anywhere on the filmstrip to move the playhead position to that frame
-   Press the spacebar or use the play/pause button to start and stop playback

### Mini Preview

Before you select clips, you can also get a quick visual preview of them in the library panel by hovering over an asset.

## Previewing Timelines

Click on any timeline from the timeline picker, or anywhere on the background of an open timeline:

-   If itâ€™s the first time accessing that timeline during the current session, the timeline clips need to be loaded into the project system. A rainbow progress bar above the timeline will display this progress.
-   Once it loads, hover anywhere in the timeline to skim it
-   Click anywhere on the timeline background to move the playhead position to that frame.
-   Press the spacebar or use the play/pause button to start and stop playback.
    -   NOTE: The timeline will dim and become non-interactive during playback to prevent changes from interrupting the steam. Pause the stream to load any changes and work in the timeline again.

## Timeline Playback Controls

To start and stop the timeline, use SPACEBAR or the play/pause button in the preview controls.

To move forward and backward one frame at a time, use the frame stepping buttons in the preview controls or use the right and left arrow keys.

Hold shift while doing this to move 10 frames at a time.

To **navigate to the previous and next edit points** in the timeline, use the up and down arrow keys.

## Loop Playback

By default playback will end at the end of a library clip or at the end of a timeline. You can enable the loop toggle in the playback controls to make playback loop continuously until manually pausing it.

## Use Ranges to Select Just What You Need from a Clip in the Preview

![Ranges in Library Previews](/static/ranges/ranges_in_preview.gif)

Adding entire clips to the timeline and then cutting or trimming down to what you need can be time consuming. Ranges enable a classic editing technique known as "3-point editing" that helps save you time by letting you select just the portion of a clip you need and add it to the timeline.

-   When you select a library item to preview, the entire range is selected by default.
-   Use the trim handles to adjust the range to the portion of the clip you want to use.
-   You can also use the keyboard shortcut `[` to set the beginning of the range and `]` to set the end of the range.
-   Once you have the range set, you can drag it into the timeline.
-   To reset a range to the entire clip, press `X` on your keyboard.
