## Previewing Library Items

## Previewing Timelines

Click on any timeline from the timeline picker, or anywhere on the background of an open timeline:

- If itâ€™s the first time accessing that timeline during the current session, the timeline clips need to be loaded into the project system. A rainbow progress bar above the timeline will display this progress.
- Once it loads, hover anywhere in the timeline to skim it
- Click anywhere on the timeline background to move the playhead position to that frame.
- Press the spacebar or use the play/pause button to start and stop playback.
    - NOTE: The timeline will dim and become non-interactive during playback to prevent changes from interrupting the steam. Pause the stream to load any changes and work in the timeline again.

## Frame Stepping

To move forward and backward one frame at a time, use the frame stepping buttons in the preview controls or use the right and left arrow keys.

Hold shift while doing this to move 10 frames at a time.

## Loop Playback

By default playback will end at the end of a library clip or at the end of a timeline. You can enable the loop toggle in the playback controls to make playback loop continuously until manually pausing it.
