Follow collaborators to see what they’re looking at — it’s like screen mirroring.

- Click on a user’s avatar in the header to begin following them
- You’ll be teleported to their current location and see a frame around the timeline in the same color as their avatar
- To snap out of the follow mode, simply click anywhere on the screen or start scrolling in the timeline
